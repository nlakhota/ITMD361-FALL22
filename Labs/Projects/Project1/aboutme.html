<body style="text-align:center"><em>Hello, I am Nakib, I currently attend Illinois Institute of Technology and am a CS Major. 
    I am 22 years old have many hobbies. Hobbies include Gaming, Sports (Playing & Watching), and F1. 
    Yes, I know F1 is in the sports category, but for me it's another hobby in itself. I am the oldest of two,
    the "other" being my younger brother. He and I love watching F1 together, sometimes as early as 7 AM in the morning.
    I know that seems tough but hey, if you really like something, support it right. My parents are both indian natives
    and immigrated here in 2008, because my uncle asked us to come here. Some games I play CSGO, Halo, Fifa, Madden, etc. I have too many.
